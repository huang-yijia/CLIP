# CLIP Zero-Shot Classification Analysis Project

## Overview

This project demonstrates and analyzes CLIP's (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training) zero-shot classification capabilities. Through systematic testing with diverse object images and text prompts, we explore the strengths and limitations of open-vocabulary vision systems.

## üéØ Project Goals

- **Demonstrate CLIP's zero-shot capabilities** with real object images
- **Analyze strengths and weaknesses** of open-vocabulary perception
- **Test diverse text prompts** including specific objects, attributes, and functional descriptions
- **Provide insights** into the challenges of building comprehensive vision systems

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- PyTorch 1.13.1+ with CUDA support
- CLIP model (ViT-B/32)

### Installation

1. **Activate the CLIP conda environment:**
   ```bash
   conda activate clip
   ```

2. **Run the zero-shot classification test:**
   ```bash
   python clip_zero_shot_test.py
   ```

## üî¨ Test Methodology

### Images Tested
- **6 diverse objects**: Apple, Banana, Cat, Dog, Hammer, Screwdriver
- **Source**: CLIP demo images (high-quality, real photographs)

### Text Prompts (29 total)
- **Specific objects**: "a photo of a hammer", "a photo of a cat"
- **Functional descriptions**: "something with a handle", "something you can eat"
- **Material properties**: "something made of metal", "something with fur"
- **Color attributes**: "something red", "something orange"
- **Size descriptions**: "something small", "something large"
- **Contextual categories**: "something in the kitchen", "something in the garage"

### Analysis Metrics
- **Confidence scores** for each image-prompt pair
- **Top matches** for each image and prompt
- **Strengths identification** (high-confidence matches)
- **Weaknesses identification** (low-confidence matches)
- **Ambiguous cases** (multiple high-confidence matches)

## üìä Key Findings

### ‚úÖ CLIP's Strengths

1. **Excellent Common Object Recognition**
   - Banana: 97.2% confidence for "a photo of a banana"
   - Dog: 79.7% confidence for "a photo of a dog"
   - Cat: 76.9% confidence for "a photo of a cat"

2. **Hierarchical Understanding**
   - Apple ‚Üí "fruit" (32.0% confidence)
   - Cat/Dog ‚Üí "pet" (12.2% and 11.1% respectively)
   - Cat/Dog ‚Üí "animal" (3.4% and 3.2% respectively)

3. **Semantic Relationships**
   - Apple/Banana ‚Üí "something you can eat" (5.3% and 0.7%)
   - Hammer/Screwdriver ‚Üí "something you can use" (12.9% and 1.6%)

### ‚ùå CLIP's Weaknesses

1. **Tool Recognition Failures**
   - Hammer: Only 0.5% confidence for "a photo of a hammer"
   - Screwdriver: Only 0.1% confidence for "a photo of a screwdriver"

2. **Material Property Confusion**
   - Screwdriver classified as "something with fur" (28.5% confidence)
   - Hammer classified as "something with fur" (15.5% confidence)

3. **Attribute Recognition Issues**
   - Poor color recognition (Apple ‚Üí "something red" only 2.8%)
   - Inconsistent size perception
   - Limited material understanding

## üîç Insights for Open-Vocabulary Perception

### Strengths
- **Natural Language Integration**: Successfully maps text descriptions to visual concepts
- **Zero-Shot Generalization**: Works without training on specific categories
- **Semantic Understanding**: Captures functional and categorical relationships

### Limitations
- **Domain Bias**: Better at common objects than specialized tools
- **Attribute Recognition**: Struggles with materials, colors, and sizes
- **Fine-Grained Discrimination**: Poor at distinguishing similar objects
- **Context Sensitivity**: Performance varies with prompt wording

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

### Core Components

1. **Image Loading** (`load_images()`)
   - Loads images from demo_images directory
   - Handles PIL Image processing
   - Error handling for corrupted files

2. **CLIP Classification** (`run_clip_classification()`)
   - Encodes images and text using CLIP
   - Computes cosine similarities
   - Returns confidence scores for all image-prompt pairs

3. **Results Analysis** (`analyze_results()`)
   - Identifies top matches for each image/prompt
   - Finds strengths and weaknesses
   - Detects ambiguous cases

### Model Configuration
- **Model**: CLIP ViT-B/32
- **Device**: CUDA GPU (with CPU fallback)
- **Preprocessing**: CLIP's standard image transforms

## üìà Usage Examples

### Running the Full Test
```bash
python clip_zero_shot_test.py
```

### Expected Output
```
Using device: cuda
CLIP model loaded successfully!
Loaded: dog, cat, screwdriver, banana, apple, hammer
